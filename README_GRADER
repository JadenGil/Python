download the online grader code.

2. Understand how the three files and all the classes work together

3. There are several things wrong with the grader 

There is only one simple exercise in each lesson
There is no way for students to enter the system and choose a subject to study
4. Make a Question class which  has an __init__ that asks  the question and checks the answer. It will have a lesson and check method. You will have to change how check works

5. Expand one of the lesson classes to have at least 3 different questions

change how the object works to have a list of questions 

6. Make these extra questions work for the Tammy testing script

 

 

**Modify Authenticator.add_user() to require that passwords include at least one special character and one number.**

In auth.py create two new exceptions:

PasswordMissingNumber

PasswordMissingSpecialCharacter

These should extend AuthException.

Modify the code to require at least one number and one special character in your code.

For purposes of this assignment, a valid number is:

('0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9')

a valid special character is:

('!','@','#','$','%','^','&','*','(',')')

One challenge that will arise, is that you need to check for the occurrence of any of a set of characters in a string.

# **Here is a hint:**

```
def containsAny(str, set):
    """ Check whether sequence str contains 
```

```
    ANY of the items in set. """
    return 1 in [c in str for c in set]
```

There are other methods to accomplish this (regular expressions), but the above uses techniques that we have learned so far.
